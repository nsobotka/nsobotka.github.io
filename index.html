              <dl>
                <dt>In 1900, nearly 40% of the class did not graduate. 76 of the 205 students left the class early. However, many of them left to start working in industry or enter law school, actions for which a degree would be critical nowadays. </dt>

                <p> Originally, Penn was a school that was mainly for students from Philadelphia and neighboring cities. The rates of international students and out of state students are shown in the graph below. </p>

                <h2> <u>Diversity</u> </h2>
                <p> The diversity in the student body seen at Penn today is also a relatively new phenomenon. In 1960, over twenty years after women were consistently admitted to Penn, there were only 4 black women, out of 267 total women, and 1074 total students.</p>

                <h2> <u>The Record: yearbooks at Penn</u> </h2>
                <p> The University has been creating yearbooks since 1852. Although this project only analyzed years beyond 1900, there are many previous books that contain interesting information. The book from 1852 is handwritten and in cursive, however, the books beyond that are in type, and could be scanned in a similar manner to this project. They could also easily be analyzed by hand: the book from 1863, for example, is only 4 pages long. They do not, however, contain the same depth of information as some of the later years books. 1863 has no complete list of students.  </p>

                <h2> <u>Women by 1940</u> </h2>
                <p> Although women were allowed into Penn, the schools were not immediately mixed. In 1940, there were 214 women compared to 516 men. Those women were distributed among 3 majors: The school of education (100 women), the college for women (103 women), and fine arts (11 women). </p>

                <h2> <u>Women by 1960</u> </h2>
                <p> By 1960, men and women were more integrated, including having one joint yearbook. However, major disparities still remained, such as the fact that there were 43 nursing students, all of which were women.</p>

                <h2> <u>Women by 1970</u> </h2>
                <p> By 1970, the yearbooks had grown in size, with nearly 1000 students per year. At this point, pictures were no longer included, and there was no clear way to distinguish men and women through the student portion of the yearbook. Furthur analysis could be done by looking at clubs, sorority, and frat sections of the book (which was not analyzed in this project) to determine the spread of men and women.</p>

                <h2> <u>Women at Penn</u> </h2>
                <p>The College of Liberal Arts for Women opened in 1933, marking the first time women were regularly admitted into Penn. This was not, however, truly the first time women came to Penn. The very first two women were admitted in 1880 into the School of Auxiliary Medicine, in 1887 the first nursing students were admitted (all women), and there were many other instances of women attending Penn, but not on a consistent basis. </p>

                <h2> <u>Trends regarding the whole student body:</u> </h2>
                <p> The breadth of majors seen at Penn has grown drastically since the 1900s. Nowadays, Penn offers nearly 100 majors. In 1900, however, there were only 4 engineering options, all of Wharton was considered the same major, and in the college many majors we have now were all lumped together under arts. </p>

                <h2> <u>Consistency across yearbooks</u> </h2>
                <p> The yearbooks were not consistent in naming majors. For example, in 1900 through 1960, there was no distinction made between any of the arts in what is now known as the school of arts and sciences. In 1970, however, the yearbook started reporting majors such as history, philosophy, sociology, and political science, none of which were seen in earlier years. Wharton also started to distinguish majors in 1970, including finance, international business, economics, sociology of work relations, accounting, political science, actuarial science, industry, and much more. </p>

                <h2> <u>Engineering</u> </h2>
                <p> Engineering has been one of the most consistent majors. Civil, electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering all existed in every yearbook that was analyzed. Obviously in recent years, many new engineering disciplines have been created, such as computer science or engineering. In 1900, these would have been unthought of disciplines. </p>

                <h2> <u>Greek life</u> </h2>
                <p> Greek life has always been a major part of life at Penn. Here is a graph showing participation rate across the years:</p>
                <p> With a little bit more work, it would be possible to separate greek life and honors societies. This would require distinguishing between the greek symbols rather than just counting how many of them there are.</p>
