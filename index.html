              <dl>
                <p>In 1900, nearly 40% of the class did not graduate. 76 of the 205 students left the class early. However, many of them left to start working in industry or enter law school, actions for which a completed degree would be required nowadays. </p>

                <h2> <u>Where Students Were From</u> </h2>
                <p> Originally, Penn was a school that was mainly for students from Philadelphia and neighboring cities. Today, Penn is a hugely international school. The graph below shows the where students are from across the years. </p>

                <h2> <u>Diversity</u> </h2>
                <p> Penn today has an extremely diverse student body, but this was not always the case. In 1960, over twenty years after women were consistently admitted to Penn, there were only 4 black women. That same year there were 267 total women and 1074 total students.</p>
                <p> Please note that the number of black women was determined by looking at the images of all the students and counting manually. It is possible that errors were made, but the trend would exist regardless. Although the exact numbers have not been counted, similar trends very likely appear in the ratios of black men to total men and with other non-white ethnicities.</p>

                <h2> <u>The Record: Yearbooks at Penn</u> </h2>
                <p> The University has been creating yearbooks since 1852. Although this project only analyzed years beyond 1900, there are many previous books that contain interesting information. For example, the yearbook from 1852 is handwritten in cursive. Books beyond this, however, were printed, and therefore could be scanned in a similar manner to this project. They could also easily be analyzed by hand: the book from 1863 is only 4 pages long. </p>
                <p> The main reason these books were not analyzed is that they do not contain the same depth of information about every student. Because 1863 is only four pages long, it has no complete list of students.  </p>

                <h2> <u>Women by 1940</u> </h2>
                <p> Although women were allowed into Penn, the schools were not immediately mixed. In 1940, there were 214 women compared to 516 men. Those women were distributed among 3 majors: The school of education (100 women), the college for women (103 women), and fine arts (11 women). </p>

                <h2> <u>Women by 1960</u> </h2>
                <p> By 1960, men and women were more integrated, including having one joint yearbook. However, major disparities still remained, such as:</p>
                     <p> - The college for women still existed.</p>
                     <p> - There were 43 nursing students, all of which were women.</p>
                     <p> - Women not in nursing or the college for women were studying education (men, for the most part, did not study education).</p>

                <h2> <u>Women by 1970</u> </h2>
                <p> By 1970, there were nearly 1000 students per year. In the 1970 yearbook there were no pictures of students, and distinctions between schools such as the college for women no longer existed. Therefore, there was no clear way to distinguish men and women through the student portion of the yearbook. Furthur analysis could be done by looking at images and rosters of clubs, sororities, and fraternities to determine the spread between men and women. This was not done for this project.</p>

                <h2> <u>Women at Penn</u> </h2>
                <p>The College of Liberal Arts for Women opened in 1933, marking the first time women were regularly admitted into Penn. This was not, however, the first time women came to Penn. The first two women were admitted in 1880 into the School of Auxiliary Medicine, and in 1887 the first class of nursing students were admitted, all of which were women. Between then and the 1930s, there were many other instances of women attending Penn, just not on a consistent basis. </p>

                <h2> <u>Majors and Greek Life</u> </h2>
                <p> The breadth of majors seen at Penn has grown drastically since the 1900s. Nowadays, Penn offers nearly 100 majors. In 1900, however, there were only 4 engineering options, all of Wharton was considered the same major (at least by the yearbook), and in the college many majors we have now were all lumped together under arts. </p>
                <p> Go up for notes on the consistency across yearbooks, right for information about the school of engineering, and down for information about greek life.</p>

                <h2> <u>Consistency across Yearbooks</u> </h2>
                <p> A major issue regarding the analysis of these yearbooks is that they were inconsistent with naming habits. For example, from 1900 through 1960 there was no distinction made between any of the arts in what is now known as the school of arts and sciences. In 1970, however, the yearbook started reporting majors such as history, philosophy, sociology, and political science, none of which were seen in earlier years. The yearbooks also started distinguishing within Wharton in 1970, including majors such as finance, international business, economics, sociology of work relations, accounting, political science, actuarial science, industry, and much more. </p>

                <h2> <u>Engineering</u> </h2>
                <p> Engineering has been one of the most consistently reported upon schools across all of the yearbooks. Civil, electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering all existed in every yearbook that was analyzed, with similar ratios of students per major (notably, civil engineering is no longer offered).  Despite this, the school of engineering has grown, and now there are more majors offered, including computer science and engineering. Obviously, these fields did not exist in the early 1900s.</p>

                <h2> <u>Greek Life</u> </h2>
                <p> Greek life and honors societies have always been a major part of life at Penn. Here is a graph showing participation rate across the years:</p>

                <p> Note that greek life data for modern day does not include honors society participation. This may help to explain why the participation rate was so high.</p>
