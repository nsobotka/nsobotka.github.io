                <p> Although women were allowed into Penn, the schools were not immediately mixed. In 1940, there were 214 women compared to 516 men. Those women were distributed among 3 majors: The school of education (100 women), the college for women (103 women), and fine arts (11 women). </p>

                <p> By 1960, men and women were more integrated, including having one joint yearbook. However, major disparities still remained, such as the fact that there were 43 nursing students, all of which were women.</p>

                <p> By 1970, the yearbooks had grown in size, with nearly 1000 students per year. At this point, pictures were no longer included, and there was no clear way to distinguish men and women through the student portion of the yearbook. Furthur analysis could be done by looking at clubs, sorority, and frat sections of the book (which was not analyzed in this project) to determine the spread of men and women.</p>
