        <h1>About Me</h1>

<!--         <p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p> -->

        <p>Hello! I'm Nathan, a PhD candidate in computer science at Stanford University, where I'm working with Professor Kunle Olukotun. My research interests are computer architecture, reconfigurable dataflow accelerators, and memory systems. Before I entered Stanford CS's PhD program in 2024, I attended the University of Pennsylvania, where I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. 
          I In my free time I love playing tennis, being active outdoors, and cooking.</p>

<!--         <p>I spent summer 2023 working with <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/" target="_blank"> Professor Joe Devietti</a> on a project called Robust Profile Guided Runtime Prefetch Generation (RPG2). 
          The project worked on dynamically inserting prefetch statements into C and C++ binaries to increase performance. RPG2 achieves of speedup of up to 2.15x. Because RPG2 is dynamic, it is capable of tuning the prefetch
          distance while the code is running, and it can turn itself off when prefetching hurts performance!

<!--         <p>Additionally, I was an intern at the NASA Langley Research Center over summer 2023. There, we worked on combining static analysis with property based testing.
          Two common property-based testing techniques, randomized testing and enumeration, both have drawbacks. Randomized testing is unlikely to find rare errors, 
          while enumeration techniques are unlikely to find large inputs that cause bugs. Because of this, we created a system that uses static analysis to find 
          the constructor patterns in Haskell code, and use those patterns to inform a combinatorial testing suite. With this extra guidance, combinatorial testing
          our testing is able to find bugs other testing methodologies cannot.

<!--         <h1>Projects</h1>

        <ul>
          <li><b>RPG2:</b> I worked on the Robust Profile Guided Runtime Prefetch Generation (RPG2) under Professor Joe Devietti. In this project we dynamically inserted prefetch statements into binaries. Inserting prefetch statements is an extremely difficult task, that varies widely based on program, input, and machine. Therefore, dynamic insertion has a few advantages over static, including the ability to tune the prefetch distance and stop prefetching should it hurt performance. I worked on testing speedup, IPC, MPKI, dynamic instruction count, and more, all across 7 different benchmarks while comparing the results to past work. Additionally, I worked on the search algorithm RPG2 uses to find the optimal prefetch distance. </li>
          <li><b>NASA:</b> As a NASA intern in combinatorial and property based testing, one partner and I reviewed multiple academic academic papers in the field of automated testing in function programming languages. Based on our findings, we identified an area that automated testing can sometimes fail to identify, that is, programs with large and rare inputs that cause bugs. Given this information, we developed a strategy for automated testing to identify these bugs: use the function constructors to inform combinatorial testing. Because any large and rare bug is likely to be due to a specific case of a function, and therefore written into the code explicitly, our testing methology will be able to identify these bugs.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/vellvm/" target="_blank">The Vellvm Project.</a> I was part of the team working on the memory model of the Vellvm Project, where I worked under Professor Steve Zdancewic. The project is available at <a href="https://github.com/vellvm" target="_blank">https://github.com/vellvm</a>. I worked on testing the memory model by writing unit tests in LLVM, automated tests in QuickChick, and writing proofs using the Coq Proof Assistant. Additionally, I worked on a creating public Monad library for Coq, where we defined and proved the monad laws and other fundamental theorems about the list, state, error, CPS, and free monads, among others.</li>
          <li><b>CIS 5550 at UPenn:</b> I developed my own search engine completely from scratch in Java. This included implementing my own webserver, key value store, and my own version of Apache spark to maximize parallelizability. On top of these foundational programs, this project included building a crawler complete with optimizations to avoid spider traps and crawl a healthy variety of pages, an indexer to compute pagerank and tf / idf values, and a frontend to display the results. The search engine was hosted on Amazon AWS, and had over 125 thousand results that could be displayed to users. </li>
          <li><b>CIS 3800 at UPenn:</b> I built an operating system in C. My portion of the project included creating the scheduler, complete with priority scheduling, blocking and sleeping, and context switching to optimize CPU utilization. I also integrated it with a custom built FAT file system and my own shell (with pipelining and background processes), complete with approximately 15-20 runnable commands. </li>
          <li><b>CIS 4710 at UPenn:</b> I implemented and tested a two way five stage superscalar pipelined processor in Verilog. It was tested using a benchmark of 1.8 million tests, and was fully functional. The processor also had all commands, including branching and memory operations. I am now a TA for the course. </li>
          <li><b>CIS 4600 at UPenn:</b> I created a playable version of Minecraft in C++. The game included functional player physics, multithreading and efficient terrain generation, as well as infinite terrain generation. It also includes many aesthetic features, such as shadow mapping, block animation, and Turing-complete redstone.</li>
